            <p>The Circle Institute was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate software engineers who recognized the
              need for accessible, high-quality coding education in Pune. Our journey began with small workshops and
              bootcamps, quickly gaining traction for our practical, hands-on approach.</p>
            <p>As our community grew, so did our offerings. We expanded our curriculum to include comprehensive courses
